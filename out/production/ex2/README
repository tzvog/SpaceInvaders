HumanShip.java - class that contains a human ship
RunnerShip.java - class that contains a Runner ship
SpaceShip.java - class that contains an Abstract space ship that all ships should follow the api

=          Design           =
=============================
from the description of the the project i understood a lot of code will needed to be reused
the rules for every space ship where clear that we must stick to the api given therefore within the
spaceship class i defined it all in a way that all spaceships must listen to the api.
for the pre defined ships given to us by the project i decided that they all sound very similar in a way
that they are all after another ship therefore i made another abstract class based on the spaceship class
called pursuit ship due to the fact that they all pursue

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
SpaceShip:
all my ships my live up to the api given to us by the therefore i made SpaceShip abstract

    Pursuit:
    from the description of the project the ship all the ships are pursuing other ships therefore it made
    sense to make an abstract class that implements that part
    to extend everything i did not want to give away the whole object therefore i used getters so the
    children can make decision on the details
        Aggressive:
        inherits pursuit but in addition tries to fire at the enemy
        Basher:
        inherits pursuit but in addition tries to bash into the enemy
        Runner:
        inherits pursuit but implements pursuing in the other direction
        Drunk:
        inherits pursuit because hes to drunk to pursuit by himself and cant tell when to shoot or not shoot
        therefore will shoot on random every few rounds because hes a slow drunk

    Human:
    is very different from the other ships due to the fact that it is controlled by a human and not \
    necessarily under pursuit for another ship

    Special ship:
    is different from the rest due to the fact that its hard to kill the human ship with pursuit but
    ambushing by staying in the same spot is easier so if a human ship passed by it the ship will just start
    firing off some rounds
